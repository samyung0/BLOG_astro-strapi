Deploying strapi for free is too painful. Render does not have a free permanent instance of postgres available and digitalOcean/heroku/railway are all paid. Deploying to aws seems like a nightmare so I will skip for now.

Also, strapi does not provide typesafe package to fetch from api endpoints and I need to manually type all the types.
